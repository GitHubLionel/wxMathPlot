# Config dialog for wxMathPlot

This is a version of MathPlotConfigDialog created with wxFormBuilder instead of wxSmith.<br>

Its only advantage is that wxFormBuilder correctly uses the wxStaticBoxSizer construct with wxStaticBox.<br>

No problems under Windows, but under Linux, numerous warnings appear in the console.<br>

See <a href="https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_static_box_sizer.html" target="_blank">wxStaticBoxSizer Class Reference</a> for more details.
